# The-Gaming-Room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room has software that is called Draw It or Lose It and it's a team based instance game where each team has 15 seconds to guess the image as it is slowly rendered over 30 seconds and after 15 seconds the other team can guess. They wanted their game to be a web based game that can run in multiple browsers and mobile devices.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I particularly did well with the analyzing each systems requirements, strengths, and considerations.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I like how each part was built upon each other in each iteration gaining more and more detailed information.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the design constraints and flesh out the keywords I used into full ideas.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on how the user would need to run it on any device they would have at the time, I chose server options that would be flexible and be able to host multiple instances at once, my idea was something like pretendyourxyzzy cards against humanity website clone.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I wanted to approach it systematically and through iterations, analyzing each requirement and coming up with a premilnary design move on to the next one see if the design works with the last topic and change till they do and so on. I also test at each stage and document each iteration so I have a roadmap of how I got there in case i need to change anything. In the future we have to put a emphasis on flexibility and adaptability in terms of scalability and novel technologies and incorparate them as the come.
